# weird things people instantly forget

# Project Overview:
This project is an interactive, fun website designed to highlight the weird and quirky things that people often forget in daily life. 
The website will allow users to explore a collection of forgotten items, tasks, and moments, providing both entertainment and engagement

# Key Features:
*Interactive Lists*: Display weird things people forget, categorized into tasks, objects, and facts.
*Search Functionality*: Users can search through the list to find a specific "forgotten" item.
*Add Your Own*: Users can submit their own quirky things they forget (using a simple form).
*Mark as Remembered*: Option for users to mark things they've “remembered.”
Dynamic Content: Use JavaScript to dynamically update the list when new items are added.

# Tech Stack:
*Frontend*: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
HTML:
Structure the content of the site: headings, lists, forms, buttons, and other elements.
Set up the basic page layout and content organization (sections, headers, footers).
CSS:
Style the elements to make the site visually appealing.
Make the site responsive, ensuring it looks good on all screen sizes.
JavaScript:
Handle user interactions like submitting a new forgotten item.
Dynamically update the list of forgotten things as users submit new content.
Create simple logic to allow users to mark things as "remembered."
Implement the search feature, allowing users to filter the list.

# Why This Project:
I chose this project because it combines fun and creativity while allowing me to improve my skills in frontend development.
 It offers the opportunity to work on interactive features using JavaScript (such as dynamically adding items to the list), 
 and improving user interface design with HTML. The project is valuable because it enhances my understanding of client-side technologies and
  helps me develop an engaging user experience.

MILESTONE 2:
- Initialize npm project using npm init .
- Add a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules/ and package-lock.json/ and then added the  `.gitignore`file  and pushed the branch
